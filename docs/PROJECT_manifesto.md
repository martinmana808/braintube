# BrainTube Project Manifesto

## Core Vision
BrainTube is a curated, distraction-free YouTube experience designed for learning, productivity, and deep focus. The goal is to escape algorithmic rabbit holes by explicitly building a personalized feed of high-quality educational channels, managing them intuitively, and processing the content intelligently with AI.

## The Problem Solved
YouTube's recommendation algorithm optimizes for watch time and engagement, often leading users into time-wasting loops. Information density is lost in clickbait, and true value is often buried. BrainTube solves this by:
- Giving control back to the user: you only see exact channels you opt-in to see.
- Categorizing and organizing creators to separate pure entertainment from learning.
- Enhancing video consumption with 1-click AI summaries to extract value faster.
- Strictly limiting fetching cycles to preserve API quotas and reduce FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).
