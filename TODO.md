QUESTION - prices? grok api? youtube api? What could happen?
TODO - system settings, should be a thing you open and close, you dont need to see it all the time, it is just 'settings', where you eventually gonna configure your BrainTube, your user, etc.
Because we've done this, 'categories y channels' remains as the third column.
TODO - Because we already 'solo' or filter by channels on the Categories & Channels column, then we should filter by categories here the same. Categories should be able to be 'Solo-ed' as channels do. 
And the text input filter to search at the top of column 1 and 2, should be removed from those columns and put on top of the channels and categories. 
TODO - You should be able to copy summary (to clipboard).
Should be able to share (it shares only the modal, as a public url, not the whole app). 
I think there could be as well a 'Download record' or something like that, That downloads the video entry as a .md file, title, url, summary, transcript, tags, etc.
