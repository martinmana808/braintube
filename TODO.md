# TODO
- on big video modal, you should be able to go right next left previous like a carousel. 
- settings and logout does not work. Instead of seeing my google user and avatar, I see a placeholder avatar and the username 'User'
- categorie NO CATEGORY cannot be selected if it already has a categoryu. 
- Los botones en la card de video en la lista deberian aparecer solo on hover.
- agregar share nativo a braintube desde youtube

# TO CONSIDER IN THE FUTURE (DO NOT ACTION YET)
- Better UI
- Proper area for saved
- ADD VIDEO should be a different hierarchy than add category and channel. Because that is not what the app is about. But it is a good feature to have. Probably it could show up in the SAVED VIDEOS panel, at the top. 
- Get proper color coding for VIDEO CATEGORY CHANNEL and be consistent about it
- get proper color coding for CHAT and SUMMARY in the video modals

- Full screen live view? Like instagram and seek it up? (just today and saved?)
- Fix ai features and connection
- Ai to create chapters in timeline
