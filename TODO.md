# TODO
- On big video modal, you should be able to go right next left previous like a carousel. 
- Settings and Logout does not work. Instead of seeing my google user and avatar, I see a placeholder avatar and the username 'User'
- categorie NO CATEGORY cannot be selected if it already has a categoryu. 
- Remove the ai chat
- Fix the ai summary capability
- Saved videos should have its own section (column) - But this one should only be seen when the user clicks on saved, or saves a video. 
- Saved videos (each saved video) should have a section for notes.
- Buttons in the video listing card should only appear on hover.
- Shorts videos should have a SHORTS pill tag like the one YOUTUBE has.

# FIX (DO NOT ACTION YET)
- the github action that runs every 6 days and keeps thje project alive, needs to be fixed.


# TO CONSIDER IN THE FUTURE (DO NOT ACTION YET)
- mejorar video modal botonera
- mejorar video card botonera
- Could we have a native share from youtube to braintube? (like save video to braintube)
- Better UI
- Proper area for saved
- ADD VIDEO should be a different hierarchy than add category and channel. Because that is not what the app is about. But it is a good feature to have. Probably it could show up in the SAVED VIDEOS panel, at the top. 
- Get proper color coding for VIDEO CATEGORY CHANNEL and be consistent about it
- get proper color coding for CHAT and SUMMARY in the video modals

- Full screen live view? Like instagram and seek it up? (just today and saved?)
- Fix ai features and connection
- Ai to create chapters in timeline
