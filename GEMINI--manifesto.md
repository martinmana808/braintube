# BrainTube Manifesto: The Soul of the Project

## The Vision
BrainTube aims to reclaim the YouTube experience for learners, thinkers, and builders. It transforms a platform of endless scrolling and distraction into a curated theater of focused knowledge.

## The Problem
YouTube is the greatest library in history, but it is also the greatest distraction machine. The algorithm prioritizes engagement over learning, and the interface is designed to keep you clicking, not thinking. For those who use YouTube as a serious tool for growth, the standard experience is "noisy" and often counter-productive.

## The Solution
BrainTube provides a "distraction-free" interface that sits on top of YouTube. It empowers the user to:
- **Curate strictly**: Only see videos from channels you've explicitly chosen to follow.
- **Categorize contextually**: Group channels by interest (e.g., "Engineering", "Stoicism", "Music Production") to enter a specific mindset without bleeding into others.
- **Synthesize with AI**: Leverage Large Language Models to summarize long-form content, allowing for rapid knowledge acquisition and decision-making on whether a video warrants a full watch.
- **Protect the Economy**: Use a "database-first" caching layer to respect API limits and ensure the tool remains fast and sustainable.

## The "What"
We are building a personalized hub where the user is the curator, the AI is the research assistant, and the interface is the sanctuary.

## Future Plans
- **Deep Search**: Searching through transcripts across all followed channels.
- **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) Integration**: Exporting notes and summaries to tools like Notion, Obsidian, or Roam.
- **Better Discovery**: AI-driven channel recommendations based on existing curation rather than watch-time algorithms.
